    coefficient for each label as metric.
    :param n_base_filters: The number of filters that the first layer in the convolution network will have. Following
    layers will contain a multiple of this number. Lowering this number will likely reduce the amount of memory required
    to train the model.
    :param depth: indicates the depth of the U-shape for the model. The greater the depth, the more max pooling
    layers will be added to the model. Lowering the depth may reduce the amount of memory required for training.
    :param input_shape: Shape of the input data (n_chanels, x_size, y_size, z_size). The x, y, and z sizes must be
    divisible by the pool size to the power of the depth of the UNet, that is pool_size^depth.
    :param pool_size: Pool size for the max pooling operations.

    :param initial_learning_rate: Initial learning rate for the model. This will be decayed during training.
